### What I do

Drawing systems with new technology stack is my hobby, solving complex problems into minor whiteboard stickies is something I feel delighted with. 

I work for frontend, backend, security and cloud solutions.

### What I am expert at

I am pretty good at architecture (both Cloud and Software) and modernization, planning move from legacy to new stack in a typical old code running organization. I have worked on digital solutions like CMS, Ecommerce, Web Application Development, also I do have good insight on backend environment.

My work includes cloud architecture for Azure, designing and architecting Landing Zones recommended by Azure. I also work on various automation activitites. I use laoguages like terraform, bicep and tools like github actions, azure devops etc

Recentely I have been tending towards use of sdks provided by cloud platforms instead of using terraform or others, so I am playing around those to build a better product and offer the use in my projects.

I am also quite passionate to work in azure, devops, already have worked on openshift, google cloud kubernetes engine and aws.

### What I am up to

I am quite interested in finding optimum solution for documenting microservices these days. I am also very interested to work on cloud native tools.
